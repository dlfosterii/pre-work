    <h1>About David</h1>

    <img src="images/illuminations.jpg" alt="My test image">

    <p> I worked for 22 years at
      <a href="http://waltdisneyworld.com">"The Most Magical Place on Earth"</a>.</p>
    <p> I was a stage tech working with lighting, audio, & pyrotechnics.
      My last several years with Disney I was part of the training team for
      Entertainment Technicians maintaining and delivering all</p>
      <ul><li>pyro training</li>
        <li>on the job training</li>
        <li>vendor training</li></ul>
      <p>As a part of my role I often quiped: "If it blows up on property, and
      we meant for it to, I had something to do with it!" I was also the webmaster
      for out team's intranet site. That is likely where my interest in coding
      started.</p>

      <p> We moved to Atlanta to be closer to family for our daughters. In an
        effort to have work/life balance, I started selling insurance including
        life insurance. How about that for irony, I go from woring with explosives
        to selling life insurance!</p>

      <p>Now I'm hoping to start my 3rd carreer...web developer. I can't wait!</p>

      <p>This line can be removed if I use this because it's added so I can do another commit.</p>
